##  Bikesharing Usage By Age
In NYC we can see that theres 2 populations that utalize the bikesharing; 25 to 35 year olds and the 50 year olds

## Records by Usertype
Out of these 2 populations, the 50 year olds conprise mostly of Customers, whereas the 25 to 35 year olds comprise mostly of Subscribers.

## Top Start and End Locations
We see that the popular locations that people tend to start and end at are places within the downtown area as the are has alot of activities for tourists.

## Comparison to Des Moines
The population in New York is approximately 8.4 million people whereas Des Moines' comes up to be about 200,000 people.
With such a large population, about 2.3 million rides were taken on the 14,000 avaiable bikes.
With 14,000 bikes available for 8.4 million people, Des Moines would only need 350 bikes to provide ride services to the 200,000 people with an estimate of 50,000 rides taken.
